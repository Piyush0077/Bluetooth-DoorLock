# Bluetooth-DoorLock
Basic Idea

 Concept of this project is completely based upon the
development of IoT in Security field using an ESP32
platform.

 It provides a linkage between the Sever and the Client
via Bluetooth.

 ESP32 will provide a Serial Bluetooth Server which is
associated with a Lock Door and a Pass Key.

 A Client can get into the range of the server and can
easily connect with the server using a Serial Terminal
Bluetooth app.

 Client will type the Pass Key on his phone

 If the Pass Key provided by the Client is correct, the door
will be unlocked.

 Else providing a wrong Pass Key will not open the door.

 If we can demonstrate the operation of an LED using the
same method. Means we can also operate any power
driven components like low power motor, smart lock,
etc.
